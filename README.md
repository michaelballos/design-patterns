### Design Patterns

This is a collection of my solutions to Leetcode design patterns. My goal is to not use any loops if possible and maintain best practices while keeping time complexity as low as I can.

If you prefer <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12pi88gHX2WOWISVAgmhgguu_vsMfL0FIO4hf6hS9a0c/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>here</a>
is the corresponding spreadsheet I made containing the patterns used to solve each problem and my code snippets to the solutions.

To run nodemon on watch mode, run the following command:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

To compile run: 
```bash
$ yarn build
```

Then check the terminal to see the logged results from solutions-log.ts

The project file structure is 

```
.
└── /src
      └── difficulty
               └── design pattern
                         └── problem.ts
      └── solutions-log.ts
```

These problems are extracted from <a href='https://neetcode.io/' target='_blank'>NeetCode.io</a> which oraganizes Leetcode problems by design patterns and difficulty. It's recommended to solve all the problems in order by difficulty.
